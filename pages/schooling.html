												<h3>Layton High School 2010 to 2012</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I graduated from Layton High in 2012 and went straight into the workforce right after.  
												I fell into the trap I feel a lot of people.  
												Take a year or so off and then I will go back to school and get a degree.  
												Will if you don&#x27;t count vocational schooling it took me nine years to go back to school and start working on a degree.

												<h3>DTC 2012, 2017 to 2019</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I started working towards a Digital Media Design certification in my last year of high school.
												It took me five years to go back and to finish up my certification program in 2019.  
												Even though it was for digital media design it had a focus on animation and game design.  
												This is where I learned that I just didn&#x27;t have the artistic skill needed to be a 3D modeler and animator.

												<h3>Weber State University 2021 to current</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I&#x27;m currently attending Weber State University to get my associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science.  
												If everything goes well this semester, I will be getting my associates.  
												With having a couple of years under my belt for college I have come to realization that I would have dropped out if I went straight into college from high school.  
												Working for those nine years has taught me hard work and dedication I needed to exceed in college.  
												I even have proof of this I was recognized by Weber State University for High Academic Excellence for the spring semester of 2022.  
												I was also recognized by Weber State University for Academic Excellence in summer semester of 2023.
											</p>

											<p>
												Has of fall semester of 2023 I have received my associate degree and only has a handful of semesters left until I get my bachelor's degree.
