												<h3>Turn-Based RPG</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Turn-based RPGs are my favorite game genre.  
												I grew up on SNES and PS1 Final Fantasy games.  
												Two of the major game ideas I have are turn-based RPGs.  
												So, this is my first attempt at making one.  
												This one is going to be closer to a game like Mario RPG.  
												Where it&#x27;s not too hard but hopefully the music and story is top notch!  
												I will do a full write up at some point in the future when it&#x27;s further along.  
												But to give a small snip it the battle system by far has been one of the most complex things I&#x27;ve coded to this day.
												Also the assets used in the game are free ones a got from <a href="https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods" target="_blank">https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods</a> 
												and <a href="https://devworm.itch.io/survival-game-godot-4-series-art" target="_blank">https://devworm.itch.io/survival-game-godot-4-series-art</a>.

												<h3>Puzzle Block</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This has been a game I&#x27;ve thought about making for a long time.  
												The idea of the game came from the puzzles from Goofy Troop that my brother and I grew up playing.  
												My thoughts were that puzzles like that world work well for a mobile game.  That the goal of this project is to get to be on mobile app stores.  
												That is also the reason why currently I&#x27;m not making that code available to be viewed.  Currently Puzzle Block has 40 levels in version 1.1 and with improvements to workflow over version 1.0.

												<h3>Game Database</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project came from the thought of using skills I learned previously and testing them out in a self-generating database.  
												As more information is put in the better the user can search and sort later own.  
												With suggestions from other people, mainly my brother, this project grew in size and complexity, taking about two weeks working eight hours a day Monday through Saturday.  
												You can find a whole work up below.

												<h3>Unreal experience</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Since I still want to work on video games, I&#x27;m learning to work in Unreal Engine 5.  
												I do have an advantage here since they use C++ for their coding.  
												C++ is the language in which I have the most experience in, this is more about learning Unreal Engine specific syntax.  
												For this I&#x27;m following along with some tutorials on YouTube.  
												In the last video I was working with there was some code that would not compile for me but would compile for him in the video.  
												After four hours over a couple of days I was finally able to get the code to compiler.  
												It had to do with method implementation in the cpp.  
												I&#x27;m not sure why they have to be implanted in different ways.  
												My guess is since the one is an empty method to be used by blueprints to essentially make the method and the other uses variables specific to the class.  
												You can see what I mean in the picture to side of this.
											</p>

											<p>
												I am working alongside the video <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/OR8/beginners-intro-to-ue5-create-a-game-in-3-hours-in-unreal-engine-5" target = "_blank">Beginners Intro to UE5 - Create a Game in 3 Hours in Unreal Engine 5.</a>  
												Once I&#x27;m done with this, I feel I will have the skills needed to make my block puzzle game.  
												I am looking forward to starting this project since I always love a challenge.

												<h3>Math Game</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was an assignment for CS3280 Object Oriented Windows Applications.  
												I was excited to work on this since it aligns with one of my goals, to work on video games.  
												It is rather a simple game, but it is a game non the less.  
												The goal of the assignment was to make a kids math game that would time them and show how many questions they answered right or wrong.  
												Then it needed a theme to go along with it.  
												I trying to be the cool uncle, made this game for the nieces and nephews who all love Pokémon.  
												So, I decided to go with a Pokémon themed math game.  
												I&#x27;m planning on working more on this project on the side so I can flush out more of mechanics so the nieces and nephews can play it as they grow up.

												<h3>Assigned Problems</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was originally a quick script I wrote in C++ for my Calculus 1 class.  
												The professor would assign every other odd.  
												Being tired from working all day for some reason it was hard to add four to the next problem.  
												So, I wrote a quick script to print out to the console every other odd and gave the total number of problems.  
												I&#39;m currently in a Windows Application class so to give myself a little more practice with C# I made it into a program as well with a couple of additional features.
