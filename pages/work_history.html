												<h3>Mowing Lawns 2003 to 2009</h3>

												<h3>Target 2012 to 2019</h3>

											<p>I was hired as a cashier but within my first ninety days I had already been transferred over to the Electronics department. A couple years in when one of my coworkers was promoted, I took over the position of setting the new release movies, books, and CDs. My last two years I was there I was the unofficial manager over the electronics. My manager would leave me in charge of the Electronics department while she managed her other areas.</p>

												<h3>McKenzie Taxidermy Supply 2019 to 2023</h3>

											<p>I was hired as a warehouse worker pulling orders and shipping them out. With my willingness to get the job done I was trained in every position at the warehouse.  I also got promoted to assistant manager after the previous assistant manager got promoted to manager of the warehouse.  This led to me running the team and making sure everything got done.</p>

												<h3>Autoliv Summer of 2024</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												I was the summer IT intern for the Tremonton facility.  
												My role was supporting the onsite staff and working on IT related projects that needed to get done.  
												Some of those projects wereâ€¦
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Moving over all manufacturing computers to Windows 10 LTSC</li>
												<li>Replacing the last Windows 7 machine that did not have a TMP chip.</li>
												<li>Switching out computers for office staff that their current computer could not upgrade to Windows 11.  
													Also helping office staff upgrade to Windows 11 if their computer was able.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												We also started working on VLAN standardization throughout the facility.  
												I could not work on this project since being an intern I did not have access to the network.  
												Thanks to my mentor I was able learn the fundamentals of a network and why VLANs are so important for security.
											</p>
											<p>
												Throughout this internship I was able to learn about how IT works throughout a large company.  
												This can be done through industry software to help track, update, change roles, give administration rights to users or computers.  
												As IT we also must coordinate with many different departments to get our projects done, as well as assist them when it wouldn&#x27;t hurt production.  
												Then for at least Autoliv as IT we oversaw pretty much anything electronic or electronic related.  
												Computers, monitors, cables, projectors, monitor mounts, and an assortment of PCI cards to work with special equipment used at the facility.  
												There&#x27;s so much more that goes into IT than I originally thought.
