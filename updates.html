										<h2>Update 9/2/2024</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Wow it&#x27;s been a while since I have updated this.  
										For a quick recap passed all my class for spring and summer with flying colors!  
										Also, I ended up doing an internship with Autoliv as IT during the summer!  
										Those are two big things that have prevented me from working on projects and or updating the website.  
										Now with the internship over and fall semester not seeming too bad hopefully I can work on some projects and let everyone know about them.  
										I do have an update for the turn-based RPG that I&#x27;ve been working on though!
									</p>

									<p>
										Summer classes weren&#x27;t too bad, I had software development two which is a class with a lot of group work.  
										So, to say I was very concerned about that is an understatement, but surprisingly it went well.  
										There were communication issues between the group, but I made the extra effort and essentially took the minutes when we would have a group call.  
										Then once we were done, I would have everyone on the call verify it was correct or add anything that I might have missed.  
										Then I would upload that into the group chat so if anyone missed the meeting they could still be informed.  
										My other classes operating systems, and Apple app development went well.  
										With the Apple class I did learn how to code Swift.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was fortunate enough to get an IT internship with Autoliv last summer.  
										When I heard the term IT my mind like most jumps to telling people to turn off and on their computer again.  
										Don&#x27;t get me wrong that did happen, and it fixed most issues that people had when the computer wasn&#x27;t running quite right.  
										At least from Autoliv there is so much more that IT handled than that.  With us being admins for the sight we had our hands in a lot of places.  
										Some of the things we would have to approve are software, user access to folders on the network drive, and giving users admin access over a certain computer so they can install department specific software.  
										We also managed the inventory of most of the electronics in the building.  
										This being computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, PCI cards, every type of cable and so much more.  
										There were some electronics we did not manage and that being anything to do with the automation machines.  
										Most of the production that went on at my facility was automated so that was handled by a different team.  
										As local IT we still had to help with the automation to make sure their connection to the network is working and if something was wrong with that, we would work with other teams to get it fixed.  
										One project that started while I was there was fixing printing issues in bay four.  
										The ticket came in saying there was a network issue in bay four, the full time IT and I went and checked what was wrong.  
										We pinged the devices and they all seem to be online.  
										We went out to one of the devices with one of the automation engineers to check their uplink with the network fluke to make sure our uplink was good.  
										It was so we reached out to our network team to see if they had any ideas what could be wrong.  
										They noticed there was a lot of traffic on that switch, more than what should have been.  
										Which come to find out there were unmanaged switched on each machine which was throwing a lot of back traffic onto that switch stack.  
										We tried to run a new cable from a different switch stack to one of the machines.  
										This improved the situation but didn&#x27;t fix it.  
										So, we ended up putting configuration on the unmanaged switches so hopefully permanently fix the problem.  
										This project ended up being put on hold due to the cost of new switches since the older ones were going to be life cycled in the following year.  
										I learned a lot about how switches and networks work in an industry setting thanks to this project and what the full time IT person taught me. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Two projects that we got done while I was there were switching out the last Windows 7 computer in the test lab that did not have a TPM chip.  
										We set up a computer on Windows 10 LTSC and got the needed software installed with help from one of the global teams.  
										When we went to swap out the computer we were there to help with any hardware-related issues.  
										The global team was in Utah at the time for some training, so they all came out to our facility to help get the software working.  
										It took almost all day, but we got it working at one point I realized the new cable we used wasn&#x27;t working.  
										I ended up grabbing a the old working one and that fixed a lot of the issues they were having.
									</p>
									<p>
										The other project we got done was switching all manufacturing computers to Windows 10 LTSC to help avoid down time when the force Windows 11 update happens.  
										Between the full-time IT and I in the time I was there we set up about ten or so computers to switch out.  
										I have experience setting up personal computers but nothing in an industrial setting.  
										Luckily the client team made this process simple to install Windows 10 LTSC with computer standard configuration on the new machines.  
										Then it was our job to get everything else set up and ready.  
										We got the generic account ready so the operators wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about signing in.  
										We deployed any need software and got any permissions needed on the computer.  
										We then reached out to the supervisor over the area where we were swapping out the computer and set up time, so we could switch it out.  
										Once we got it switched out, we would decommission the old computer software the company used to track the computers.
									</p>
									<p>
										The last project that unfortunately I could not be a part of, but I learned a lot was VLAN standardization.  
										Since I only being an intern, I did not have network access so I could not change the VLANS on the switch.  
										So, I ended up watching and learning from the full time IT about the VLAN standardization process and why they are so important for security.  
										Thats especially is true for our facility since they are always worried about downtime of the machines.   
										The big one was making it, so the computers of the manufacturing machine weren&#x27;t on the same VLAN as the office computers.  
										This protects networks since if a virus is downloaded on one network it can&#x27;t spread easily to the other.  
										To be honest with how locked down the internet is on a manufacturing PC the virus would come from the office staff.  
										So, we were basically protecting the manufacturing machine from the office users.  But that was pretty much it for what I worked on while at Autoliv.  
										We also had a project of upgrading any office computer that wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade to Windows 11.  
										This wasn&#x27;t due till October 2025, but we got it pretty much all the way done while I was there.  
										They also started to roll out the Windows 11 update to office users, so we had a lot of people who needed help when something went wrong with the installation.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, onto project updates which will be a lot shorter.  
										This is because I haven&#x27;t really worked on them since the last update.  
										For the turn-based RPG I was able to get a fully running battle system as well as a one working map.  
										The battle system I ended up making it where the calculations and everything is done in battle code.  
										Then it will pass the damage or healing to the appropriate target.  
										But alas I cannot be satisfied, and I want to rework it, so it runs better, refactoring here I come!  
										For puzzle block not much has been going on since I&#x27;m at the point of making levels.  
										I find the challenge of making levels fun but just haven&#x27;t had time or the drive to come up with any new one.  
										It did make me laugh though I went to play puzzle block the other day and levels I had down since I need to make realistic goals to achieve for time and movement counter.  
										I can&#x27;t solve in the allocated time or moves anymore, so guess the levels aren&#x27;t as easy as I thought.  
										Then for the game database I haven&#x27;t looked at yet to see where I am.  
										From what I can remember the version on GitHub is out of date from my test model.  
										But I&#x27;m not sure if that is because it&#x27;s not working, or I just haven&#x27;t updated it yet.  
										Just another thing on the To Do list.

												<h3>Update 2/29/2024</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Another month down for the new year.  Things have been going well school and project wise.  
												Puzzle Block is up to 40 levels now and I have reworked my code to make producing levels easier.  
												As I learn more about Godot it is interesting to see how much my code has changed from the beginning of the project.  
												It&#x27;s most noticeable in the level creation, the base template I use keeps changing.  
												It makes me laugh looking between level 1 code and level 40 code.  I am also continuing adding new features and more levels.
											</p>
		
											<p>
												I also started a new game project that is a turn-based RPG, one of my personal favorite genres.  
												Currently I&#x27;m working on the battle system which I have a very basic working prototype.  
												That being said I think I&#x27;m making it a lot harder than it should be.  
												I essentially have two scripts that handle all passing around of the player and enemy characters information.  
												While having a third managing the player inputs and being the middleman of the other two scripts.  
												I think I can get of rid the two scripts that are handling the passing around data.  
												My thoughts are I can keep the players and enemies&#x27; objects in arrays and have their code handle more of the work and keep the middleman script to keep track whose currently active and selecting targets.  
												Which means after getting done updating the website I&#x27;m going to be essentially be deleting all my code and starting over.  
												Like Mark Watney said in the Martian “They say no plan survives first contact with implementation.”  That quote summons up all my first ideas for any of my coding projects.

											<p>
												Spring semester is in full swing, and things are going well.  I&#x27;m ahead in all my classes and this allows me to still work on projects.  
												As of the last update I have a fully functional game with ten levels ready to go.  
												Currently this is my main project I&#x27;m working on but I&#x27;m also working on updating that Game database.  
												I&#x27;m adding it so users will not have to use the API which was my original plan to being with.  
												I thought that would take a couple of hours to get to work but sadly I was wrong, and I ran into more problems.  Version 1.1 should be coming hopefully next month.  
											</p>
		
											<p>
												Here is a download link for my <a href="puzzle_block.zip">Puzzle Block</a> for window computers.  I&#x27;m eventually going to make it work on more platforms, but I wanted to get something up for the website.  
												Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not going to be releasing the code for this project since I&#x27;m hoping sometime in the future to release a finished game in the future.     
											</p>
		
											
											<p>
												Mini update I also added a new repository of my past coding assignment from college.  It is set to private so if you want to see it, please email me at 
												<a href="mailto:trevjegbert21@outlook.com" target = "_blank">trevjegbert21@outlook.com</a> with either your GitHub username, 
												full name or the email address related to your GitHub account.  Then I can add you as a collaborator and you can have access to the repository.
												Also I got the Game Database to run without having to use the API.

												<h3>1/5/2024</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												<p>
													For the last week of winter break I devoted myself to figuring out what engine to build my sliding block game on.  
													Since my idea was for a top down 2D view Unreal Engine felt a little over kill.  
													The main reason I wanted to use it for the game was the easy porting to other platforms, mainly mobile.  
													Say the least my game wouldn&#x27;t come close to the full potential Unreal Engine would offer.  
													So, to start off this week it was about finding an engine to work with.  
													My first thought was Game Maker since I have some experience with that engine, but I wanted to see what else was out there.  
													After a handful of hours of watching videos and reading forms I decided to go with Godot.  
													The three biggest selling points were the ability of doing 3D and 2D, its free, and its open source.  
													Since a lot of the information, I was reading was a couple of years old I found out when I started to work on a game it also supports easy porting to mobile now!
												</p>
			
												<p>
													So, to start this journey with Godot I started to go through tutorials to get feel for how the engine works.  
													To start off Godot works with a couple of different coding languages you can write in its own language, C#, and C++.  
													Godot&#x27;s language works seamlessly with engine, C# takes a little bit to getting to work with engine, while C++ takes some work to get working with the engine.  
													With most tutorials that are out there they use Godot&#x27;s language, so I decided to give it a try.  
													The worst thing that happens is I end up switching to one of the other languages I am very familiar with.  
													Godot&#x27;s language works a lot like Python, so I was able to pick up fast since I have at least one class worth of Python experience.  
													From there it was just learning how the node and signally systems worked.  
													The tutorials helped with this some but diving headfirst into a project is sometimes the best way to learn and that is what I did.  
													The first attempt at the block sliding was using the built in collision to handle when the player could move the piece again.  
													This went well, I had to look a lot of stuff up but again that is how we learn.  
													After a day of working on it I had a fully working protype that the player could switch between different blocks and solve a puzzle using them.  
													There was one glaring issue was randomly blocks would get stuck on nothing.  
													From doing some investigating it was caused by the size of the collision field, but this led to another problem.  
													When trying to line up going between blocks it would sometimes catch on a corner since it was off by 0.001 or less.  
													Tired, I stopped working for that day and got a fresh start the next day.  
													While trying to figure out a way to make sure everything was pixel perfect, I found they had a raytracing in the engine.  
													So, I started to use that no dealing the being pixel perfect as along has the ray trace had a line of sight, I was good.  
													Another sixish hours not understanding how it worked with the engine figuring that out and repeating this cycle over and over again.  
													Until I was at the same point as the previous protype but without the annoying snagging issue.  
													I felt great except for the fact the animation looks weird while the block is sliding but I prefer a working game over a slightly weird movement. 
													 I plan one working on this and perfecting it to hopefully make it available on mobile, but progress will slow with school starting back up on the 8th.

												A long update will be forthcoming but just a little teaser for the video game database.  
												I have it fully working but the methods my professor taught me how to access the database doesn&#x27;t work since git ignores the bin folders.  
												All the code is up on <a href="https://github.com/TJEgbert/GameDatabase">GitHub</a>, but it doesn&#x27;t work since it can&#x27;t get access to the database.  That will be tomorrow&#x27;s Trevor&#x27;s problem.  
												Hopefully tomorrow the code will all be fixed, and a full report will be up here.

											Finally fall semester is over and it&#x27;s time for winter break!  Which means for me working on my portfolio and applying for more internships in hopes of getting one.  
											As for updates in Unreal Engine 5 I have finished the tutorials and started working on my own project which is not going well.  
											The biggest reason I went back to UE5 was the ease of porting to other platforms but also to get experience working with a popular engine.  
											As my professor from CS3280 stressed frequently don&#x27;t force a project into a certain programming language find the one that works best for project.  
											So, with a heavy heart I put that project aside while I tried to figure out the best engine to use.  
										</p>
										
										<p>
											While I do research for that I will start working on a new project and the game database seems like a fun project to work on.  
											My original plan for the project was going to be a self-made database as the user enters in more information more options for things like developer, status, platform, etc. would be added to drop down menus to make the process faster.  
											Well has I was getting input from other people about features they might want to see my brother brought up using an API to make a search feature and it could fill some of the base information like developer, year of release and such.  
											I did find one that is through IGDB which is free for non-commercial use.  Here&#x27;s a rough outline of the steps for this project.
										</p>
										
										<ul>
