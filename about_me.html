										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I like most growing up, I wanted to be many things astronaut, chemist, crime scene investigator, and architect.  
										One job stuck with me with me for the longest time was wanting to work on video games.  
										This led to me wanting to be an animator but after a course at the Davis Technical College my artistic skills made it clear that was not a career for me.  
										A year or so later I started working on a course through Udemy about working in Unreal Engine 4 with C++ to achieve my dream job of working on video games.  
										During the course I realized I had a knack for coding.  I started to investigate software developer careers and notice they all need a degree in Computer Science or similar work experience. 
										So naturally I thought an internship would be a good start, but all had the same requirement you needed to be working towards a degree in computer science.  
										Hence at the age of twenty-seven I went back to school and started on my associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science at Weber State University.
									</p>
									<p>
										I&#x27;m working on my third year at Weber State University.  
										If I don&#x27;t fail, my statics or physics class this semester I will be graduating with my associate degree.  
										After that all my general course are done and all have left are upper division classes for my bachelor's degree.  
										If everything goes according to plan, I will be graduating with my bachelor&#x27;s after fall semester.  
										Durning this time I have been searching for an internship, but I haven&#x27;t had much luck.  
										The biggest contributing factor I think is a lack of a portfolio with projects I&#x27;ve been working on.  
										The issue was I never had time to work on projects since I had schoolwork and a full-time job I was working.  
										That has all changed though I was lucky enough to receive a scholarship that pays for the Fall and Spring semester.  
										Now the money I had saved up to pay for those two semesters was just sitting there.  
										I decided to take a risk and quit my warehouse job to focus on working on projects to build my portfolio while living off those savings.  
										This is in hopes instead of going back to retail or a warehouse job that I can start working in software development field.  
										I would probably work best on the backend; I could do front end if I didn&#x27;t have to design anything.

									<h2>Currently working on</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>A program that I can save and track my video game collection.  While also being able to mark off what I have beaten before.</li>
										<li>Block puzzle game</li>
										<li>Turn based RPG.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>To see more information about these you can head over to the projects page.  There are some projects I&#x27;ve completed, and any general updates or projects updates can be found there.</p>
