										<h2>Update 9/2/2024</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Wow it&#x27;s been a while since I have updated this.  
										For a quick recap passed all my class for spring and summer with flying colors!  
										Also, I ended up doing an internship with Autoliv as IT during the summer!  
										Those are two big things that have prevented me from working on projects and or updating the website.  
										Now with the internship over and fall semester not seeming too bad hopefully I can work on some projects and let everyone know about them.  
										I do have an update for the turn-based RPG that I&#x27;ve been working on though!
									</p>

									<p>
										Summer classes weren&#x27;t too bad, I had software development two which is a class with a lot of group work.  
										So, to say I was very concerned about that is an understatement, but surprisingly it went well.  
										There were communication issues between the group, but I made the extra effort and essentially took the minutes when we would have a group call.  
										Then once we were done, I would have everyone on the call verify it was correct or add anything that I might have missed.  
										Then I would upload that into the group chat so if anyone missed the meeting they could still be informed.  
										My other classes operating systems, and Apple app development went well.  
										With the Apple class I did learn how to code Swift.
									</p>
									<p>
										I was fortunate enough to get an IT internship with Autoliv last summer.  
										When I heard the term IT my mind like most jumps to telling people to turn off and on their computer again.  
										Don&#x27;t get me wrong that did happen, and it fixed most issues that people had when the computer wasn&#x27;t running quite right.  
										At least from Autoliv there is so much more that IT handled than that.  With us being admins for the sight we had our hands in a lot of places.  
										Some of the things we would have to approve are software, user access to folders on the network drive, and giving users admin access over a certain computer so they can install department specific software.  
										We also managed the inventory of most of the electronics in the building.  
										This being computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, PCI cards, every type of cable and so much more.  
										There were some electronics we did not manage and that being anything to do with the automation machines.  
										Most of the production that went on at my facility was automated so that was handled by a different team.  
										As local IT we still had to help with the automation to make sure their connection to the network is working and if something was wrong with that, we would work with other teams to get it fixed.  
										One project that started while I was there was fixing printing issues in bay four.  
										The ticket came in saying there was a network issue in bay four, the full time IT and I went and checked what was wrong.  
										We pinged the devices and they all seem to be online.  
										We went out to one of the devices with one of the automation engineers to check their uplink with the network fluke to make sure our uplink was good.  
										It was so we reached out to our network team to see if they had any ideas what could be wrong.  
										They noticed there was a lot of traffic on that switch, more than what should have been.  
										Which come to find out there were unmanaged switched on each machine which was throwing a lot of back traffic onto that switch stack.  
										We tried to run a new cable from a different switch stack to one of the machines.  
										This improved the situation but didn&#x27;t fix it.  
										So, we ended up putting configuration on the unmanaged switches so hopefully permanently fix the problem.  
										This project ended up being put on hold due to the cost of new switches since the older ones were going to be life cycled in the following year.  
										I learned a lot about how switches and networks work in an industry setting thanks to this project and what the full time IT person taught me. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Two projects that we got done while I was there were switching out the last Windows 7 computer in the test lab that did not have a TPM chip.  
										We set up a computer on Windows 10 LTSC and got the needed software installed with help from one of the global teams.  
										When we went to swap out the computer we were there to help with any hardware-related issues.  
										The global team was in Utah at the time for some training, so they all came out to our facility to help get the software working.  
										It took almost all day, but we got it working at one point I realized the new cable we used wasn&#x27;t working.  
										I ended up grabbing a the old working one and that fixed a lot of the issues they were having.
									</p>
									<p>
										The other project we got done was switching all manufacturing computers to Windows 10 LTSC to help avoid down time when the force Windows 11 update happens.  
										Between the full-time IT and I in the time I was there we set up about ten or so computers to switch out.  
										I have experience setting up personal computers but nothing in an industrial setting.  
										Luckly the client team made this process simple to install Windows 10 LTSC with computer standard configuration on the new machines.  
										Then it was our job to get everything else set up and ready.  
										We got the generic account ready so the operators wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about signing in.  
										We deployed any need software and got any permissions needed on the computer.  
										We then reached out to the supervisor over the area where we were swapping out the computer and set up time, so we could switch it out.  
										Once we got it switched out, we would decommission the old computer software the company used to track the computers.
									</p>
									<p>
										The last project that unfortunately I could not be a part of, but I learned a lot was VLAN standardization.  
										Since I only being an intern, I did not have network access so I could not change the VLANS on the switch.  
										So, I ended up watching and learning from the full time IT about the VLAN standardization process and why they are so important for security.  
										Thats especially is true for our facility since they are always worried about downtime of the machines.   
										The big one was making it, so the computers of the manufacturing machine weren&#x27;t on the same VLAN as the office computers.  
										This protects networks since if a virus is downloaded on one network it can&#x27;t spread easily to the other.  
										To be honest with how locked down the internet is on a manufacturing PC the virus would come from the office staff.  
										So, we were basically protecting the manufacturing machine from the office users.  But that was pretty much it for what I worked on while at Autoliv.  
										We also had a project of upgrading any office computer that wouldn&#x27;t be able to upgrade to Windows 11.  
										This wasn&#x27;t due till October 2025, but we got it pretty much all the way done while I was there.  
										They also started to roll out the Windows 11 update to office users, so we had a lot of people who needed help when something went wrong with the installation.
									</p>
									<p>
										Finally, onto project updates which will be a lot shorter.  
										This is because I haven&#x27;t really worked on them since the last update.  
										For the turn-based RPG I was able to get a fully running battle system as well as a one working map.  
										The battle system I ended up making it where the calculations and everything is done in battle code.  
										Then it will pass the damage or healing to the appropriate target.  
										But alas I cannot be satisfied, and I want to rework it, so it runs better, refactoring here I come!  
										For puzzle block not much has been going on since I&#x27;m at the point of making levels.  
										I find the challenge of making levels fun but just haven&#x27;t had time or the drive to come up with any new one.  
										It did make me laugh though I went to play puzzle block the other day and levels I had down since I need to make realistic goals to achieve for time and movement counter.  
										I can&#x27;t solve in the allocated time or moves anymore, so guess the levels aren&#x27;t as easy as I thought.  
										Then for the game database I haven&#x27;t looked at yet to see where I am.  
										From what I can remember the version on GitHub is out of date from my test model.  
										But I&#x27;m not sure if that is because it&#x27;s not working, or I just haven&#x27;t updated it yet.  
										Just another thing on the To Do list.

												<h3>Turn-Based RPG</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Turn-based RPGs are my favorite game genre.  
												I grew up on SNES and PS1 Final Fantasy games.  
												Two of the major game ideas I have are turn-based RPGs.  
												So, this is my first attempt at making one.  
												This one is going to be closer to a game like Mario RPG.  
												Where it&#x27;s not too hard but hopefully the music and story is top notch!  
												I will do a full write up at some point in the future when it&#x27;s further along.  
												But to give a small snip it the battle system by far has been one of the most complex things I&#x27;ve coded to this day.
												Also the assets used in the game are free ones a got from <a href="https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods" target="_blank">https://game-endeavor.itch.io/mystic-woods</a> 
												and <a href="https://devworm.itch.io/survival-game-godot-4-series-art" target="_blank">https://devworm.itch.io/survival-game-godot-4-series-art</a>.

												<h3>Puzzle Block</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This has been a game I&#x27;ve thought about making for a long time.  
												The idea of the game came from the puzzles from Goofy Troop that my brother and I grew up playing.  
												My thoughts were that puzzles like that world work well for a mobile game.  That the goal of this project is to get to be on mobile app stores.  
												That is also the reason why currently I&#x27;m not making that code available to be viewed.  Currently Puzzle Block has 40 levels in version 1.1 and with improvements to workflow over version 1.0.

												<h3>Game Database</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project came from the thought of using skills I learned previously and testing them out in a self-generating database.  
												As more information is put in the better the user can search and sort later own.  
												With suggestions from other people, mainly my brother, this project grew in size and complexity, taking about two weeks working eight hours a day Monday through Saturday.  
												You can find a whole work up below.

												<h3>Unreal experience</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Since I still want to work on video games, I&#x27;m learning to work in Unreal Engine 5.  
												I do have an advantage here since they use C++ for their coding.  
												C++ is the language in which I have the most experience in, this is more about learning Unreal Engine specific syntax.  
												For this I&#x27;m following along with some tutorials on YouTube.  
												In the last video I was working with there was some code that would not compile for me but would compile for him in the video.  
												After four hours over a couple of days I was finally able to get the code to compiler.  
												It had to do with method implementation in the cpp.  
												I&#x27;m not sure why they have to be implanted in different ways.  
												My guess is since the one is an empty method to be used by blueprints to essentially make the method and the other uses variables specific to the class.  
												You can see what I mean in the picture to side of this.
											</p>

											<p>
												I am working alongside the video <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/OR8/beginners-intro-to-ue5-create-a-game-in-3-hours-in-unreal-engine-5" target = "_blank">Beginners Intro to UE5 - Create a Game in 3 Hours in Unreal Engine 5.</a>  
												Once I&#x27;m done with this, I feel I will have the skills needed to make my block puzzle game.  
												I am looking forward to starting this project since I always love a challenge.

												<h3>Math Game</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was an assignment for CS3280 Object Oriented Windows Applications.  
												I was excited to work on this since it aligns with one of my goals, to work on video games.  
												It is rather a simple game, but it is a game non the less.  
												The goal of the assignment was to make a kids math game that would time them and show how many questions they answered right or wrong.  
												Then it needed a theme to go along with it.  
												I trying to be the cool uncle, made this game for the nieces and nephews who all love Pokémon.  
												So, I decided to go with a Pokémon themed math game.  
												I&#x27;m planning on working more on this project on the side so I can flush out more of mechanics so the nieces and nephews can play it as they grow up.

												<h3>Assigned Problems</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This was originally a quick script I wrote in C++ for my Calculus 1 class.  
												The professor would assign every other odd.  
												Being tired from working all day for some reason it was hard to add four to the next problem.  
												So, I wrote a quick script to print out to the console every other odd and gave the total number of problems.  
												I&#39;m currently in a Windows Application class so to give myself a little more practice with C# I made it into a program as well with a couple of additional features.
