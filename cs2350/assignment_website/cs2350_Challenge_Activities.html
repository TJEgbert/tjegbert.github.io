            <h1>Module 2 Challenges</h1>
            <h3><a href="2-5_challenge/story_layout1.html"> Layout 1</a></h3>
            <figure id="fig1">
                <a href="2-5_challenge/story_layout1.html"><img src="images/cs2350_layout_1.png" alt="Challenge layout 1"></a>
            </figure>
            <p>
                For layout 1 I used float to get the layout I wanted for this page.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="2-5_challenge/story_layout2.html"> Layout 2</a></h3>
            <figure id="fig2">
                <a href="2-5_challenge/story_layout2.html"><img src="images/cs2350_layout_2.png" alt="Challenge layout 2"></a>
            </figure>
            <p>
                For layout 2 I used a gird layout to arrange the content.  I did have some trouble getting the images where I wanted
                but was able to make it to work. 
            </p>

            <h3><a href="2-5_challenge/myschedule.html"> My Schedule</a></h3>
            <figure id="fig3">
                <a href="2-5_challenge/myschedule.html"><img src="images/cs2350_My_Schedule.png" alt="Challenge layout 2"></a>
            </figure>
            <p>
                For this one we used table formating to create a schedule table.  I kept getting rowspan and colspan mixed it
                a little debugging was necessary after typing out the code.

            <h1>Module 3 Challenges</h1>
            <h3><a href="3-6/pet_competition.html"> Pet Competition Web Form</a></h3>
            
                <a href="3-6/pet_competition.html"><img src="images/cs2350_3-6_challenge.png" alt="Challenge web form"></a>
            <p>
                For this challenge we made a webform for a pet competition webiste.
            </p>

            <h1>Module 5 Challenges</h1>
            <h3><a href="5-5/arrays.html"> Using Dates, Arrays, Loops, and Conditional Statements</a></h3>
            
                <a href="5-5/arrays.html"><img src="images/cs2350_5-5_challenge_DALCS.png" alt="5-5 Challenge JavaScript coding"></a>
            <p>
                For this challenge we used JavaScript to get information from arrays, sorting out the information with functions 
                and conditional statements.  This assignment was fun with prior coding experience I started to type code to search
                for "n" within the color by looping through the string.  With JavaScript having so many built in function I looked it up
                just to see if there was any easier way and found there was.
            </p>

            <h1>Module 6 Challenges</h1>
            <h3><a href="6-5/aboutMe/aboutme.html">Manipulating the DOM: About Me</a></h3>
            
                <a href="6-5/aboutMe/aboutme.html"><img src="images/cs2350_6-5_challenge_aboutMe.png" alt="6-5 Challenge Manipulating the DOM: About Me"></a>
            <p>
                For this challenge we used JavaScript to create new HTML elements set there attribute and add them to the website.  For this portion of
                I had a fair amount debugging to do with this one but I was able to make it work.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="6-5/myCollection/myCollection.html">Manipulating the DOM: My Collection</a></h3>
            
                <a href="6-5/myCollection/myCollection.html"><img src="images/cs2350_6-5_challenge_myCollection.png" alt="6-5 Challenge Manipulating the DOM: My Collection"></a>
            <p>
                For this challenge we used JavaScript to create new HTML elements set there attribute and add them to the website.  For this portion before I got into 
                making the table I planned out what would be needed and did some pseudocode for it.  It made the coding much smoother and less debugging.
            </p>

            <h3><a href="6-7/pet_competition.html">Handling Events on Form Elements</a></h3>
            
            <a href="6-7/pet_competition.html"><img src="images/cs2350_6-7_challenge.png" alt="6-7: Challenge: Handling Events on Form Elements"></a>
            <p>
                For this challenge we used JavaScript to get information from a form and update other parts of the form in real time.  I ran into an issue with making the total
                cost update past 1,000.  I figured out I needed to remove the comma from the string and did the calculation.  Then reformatted it with two decimals and commas intact.
            </p>

            <h1>Module 7 Challenges</h1>
            <h3><a href="7-1/matching.html">JavaScript Final</a></h3>
            
                <a href="7-1/matching.html"><img src="images/cs2350_7-1_challenge.png" alt="7-1 Challenge: JavaScript Final"></a>
            <p>
                For the final for JavaScript, we made a matching game using JavaScript.  I had it working within a couple hours but if you clicked really fast you could get more than
                two clicked before it reset.  Over a couple days it took many hours to make all work again and functioning.  I find JavaScript to be fun to code in but a pain to 
                debug.
