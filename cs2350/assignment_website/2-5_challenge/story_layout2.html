                        Arsène Lupin is a fictional gentleman thief created by Maurice Leblanc back in the 1905.  
                        Arsène like Robin Hood would only still from the people who could afford being stolen from, or corrupted people who got rich from ill-gotten gains.  
                        What made Arsène different though he would send a “Calling Card” to announce when and where he be stealing something and sometimes but not always give that money to the poor.  
                        Even with the heads up to the police Arsène stayed one step ahead.  Even when he did get caught, he was able to escape from the police.  
                        He even went toe to toe with Sherlock Holmes the great detective written by Sir Authur Conan Doyle in 1887 and came out victories.

                        In the current age we have heist movies, but nothing that matches up to Arsène Lupin. That was true until today.  
                        I bring news of the modern day Arsène Lupin, Gary.  Not much is known about Gary with being a master of disguise he slips in out with no one knowing.  
                        We think he might be working with a group, but we cannot say for sure.  
                        In this article we are going till you about his first theft and his new biggest heist yet.

                    <h2>The theft and Return of the Mona Lisa!</h2>
                    <img src="images/layout_mona.png" alt="Mona Lisa" />
                    <p>
                        Little did the universe know that Gary just to prove himself to the public stole that Mona Lisa from the Louvre in Paris.  
                        This happened last summer, and our reporter was in Paris when it happened.  In the middle of the night our reporter was awoken to an uproar in the streets.  
                        The reporter rushed outside and made there way towards the noise.  Once the reporter got to the source of the noise, they found themselves in front of Louvre.  
                        As the reporter approached, they heard the rumors of the Mona Lisa being stolen and a strange letter left where the Mona Lisa was.  
                        Thanks to an inside source in the police department our reporter was able to read the letter and it read.  
                        “I the great thief Gary as you can see stole the Mona Lisa.  This was just an example of what you can expect from me in the future.  
                        As with being an example I&apos;m going to be returning the Mona Lisa tomorrow night.  Yours truly Gary”.  
                        With the area swarming with police everyone thought Gary was going to get caught but he was able to return the Mona Lisa without getting caught.  
                        The local government never reported the name of thief who stole and returned the Mona Lisa.

                        Since the event in Paris not much has been heard from Gary.  The was just recently a letter sent to none other than Supreme Leader of the Galaxy Tem.  
                        During the last election Lampoplois have been put on the endanger species list with their ever-decreasing number.  
                        Gary sent a calling called to Tem stating that on 9-19-2222 all the ill-gotten gains will be stolen and returned to the lamp population of Lampoplois  
                        We will keep you updated on the developing story.
