                    My name is Trevor Egbert I was born on July 16 1993 I am the youngest of three kids. 
                    I am the proud uncle of four necies and newphews with another right around the conner 
                    Growing up like most kids what I wanted to be change drastically.  Astronaut, 
                    forensic technician and architect to name a few.  There was always one thing I 
                    went back to though and that was working on video games.  Properly since playing video 
                    games were and still is my favorite past time.  Once I hit High School my goal was to make 
                    video games.  With that as a goal I went to the Davis Technical College to get a 
                    certification in animation.  My animation skills where good but my 3D modeling skills 
                    not so much.  I ended completing the course, but I never did anything with it 
                    because of my 3D modeling skills.  Cut to 2020 I ended up getting a course on 
                    Udemy on Unreal Engine with C++.  I found with doing that course I had a knack for
                    coding.  With rising prices and a goal in mind I applied to Weber State University in 
                    2021 to hope of getting into the video game industry.  If for some reason that doesn't happen, I will
                    at least have a fall back with a Computer Science degree.
