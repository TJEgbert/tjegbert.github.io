                    I have really enjoyed the CS classes so far, I especially liked CS 1400.  This class
                    was my first interaction with working with Python.  With prior experience working with 
                    C++ from my Udemy course I was able to grasp the concepts quickly.  What made this class 
                    one of my favorites was we were learning Python while working on computer games. 
                    Since that what I want to do as career, and I find making games fun!

                <h3>Academic Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>
                    While attending Davis Technical college I was asked and joined the National Technical Honor Society.
                    Then in spring Semester of 2022 was I recognized by Weber State University for High Academic Excellence.

                <h3>Other Learning Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn how to work in Unreal Engine so I could start making games but
                    I also wanted to learn a general skill to.  I found a course called "Unreal Engine C++ Developer:
                    Learn C++ and Make Video Games" provide by Udemy that fulfilled both criteria. After a couple of 
                    months I had completed the course and received this certificate of completion for it.
