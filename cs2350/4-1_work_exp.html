                    My brother and I would mow lawns for a handful of people around our neighborhood at that time.  Once 
                    my brother got his license we did branch out and took a couple more lawns that was outside walking distance.

                    I was hired on as a cashier but within my first ninety days I had already been transferred over to the Electronics department.
                    I couple years in when one of my coworkers was promoted, I took over setting the new release movies, books, and CDs.
                    My last two years there I was the unofficial assistance manager over the electronics.  My manager would leave me in charge 
                    of the Electronics department while she managed her other areas.
